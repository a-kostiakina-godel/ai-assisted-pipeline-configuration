Create a GitHub Actions workflow at .github/workflows/playwright-tests.yml with the following exact requirements:

Triggers
Run only on pull requests targeting the main branch (pull_request with branches: [ main ]).
Runner & toolchain
Use ubuntu-latest.
Use the latest LTS Node.js via actions/setup-node@v4 with cache: yarn.

Install
Install dependencies with Yarn:
yarn install --immutable --immutable-cache --check-cache
Install Playwright browsers with system deps:
yarn playwright install --with-deps

Test
Run Playwright tests in parallel:
yarn playwright test
Set CI=true in the job env.
Set timeout-minutes: 30 on the job.

Artifacts (always upload)
Upload the HTML report directory (playwright-report) as artifact named playwright-html-report.
Upload Playwright traces (e.g. test-results/\*_/trace_.zip or the default traces folder) as artifact named playwright-traces.
Use if: always() on artifact upload steps.

YAML quality
Single job named playwright-tests.
Minimal permissions (read-only) and concurrency to cancel in-progress runs per PR (use a sensible group expression).
Add a final steps order: checkout → setup-node → yarn install → playwright install → test → artifact uploads.
Include brief comments explaining key steps.

Deliverable
Output only the complete YAML. No additional explanation or commentary.
